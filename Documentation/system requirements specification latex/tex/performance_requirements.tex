The application is a mobile based application and hence some performance measure like calculation time and battery consumption become very crucial.

\subsection{Calculation Time}
\subsubsection{Description}
Due to timing requirements of handling live, wild animals. The system shall perform calculation measurements quickly enough so that the fish does not become over-stressed nor asphyxiates. Quick calculation time will also reduce the annoyance to the user while waiting for the result

\subsubsection{Constraints}
The calculation algorithm need to be optimize-able to reduce calculation time
\subsubsection{Standards}
None
\subsubsection{Priority}
High\\

\subsection{Battery Consumption}
\subsubsection{Description}
The application should utilize as less energy as it can as peole using this app is assumed to have gone fishing and is not in quick access to electricity so the application must not drain the power of the smart-phone.

\subsubsection{Constraints}
The smart-phone should be capable enough to handle current mobile applications as older divice tend to have low battery life.
\subsubsection{Standards}
None
\subsubsection{Priority}
Critical
