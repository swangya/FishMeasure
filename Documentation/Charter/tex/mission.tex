The aim is to create a mobile application that can be installed on an iPhone or Android device. Users will be able to snap the picture of the fish and would have to put a Quarter next to it at same depth from the device and the application will measure the length of the fish in terms of the length of quarter. Using that information it will be possible to calculate the approximate length of the fish.
