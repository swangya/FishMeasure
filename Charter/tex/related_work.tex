Some related projects are FishFigure, Fish measurement, Hapyson fishing measurement and BAKUCHO measure. Most of these apps do not have image recognition feature. Hapyson fishing measurement app measures the length of fish based on the marker but we have to buy their marker. Our app will able to use common objects as a marker. The other feature that our app will be different is that it will have a feature to ask help from other fishermen to identify the catch.
