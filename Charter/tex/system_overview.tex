The system will be an android app that will help fishermen to measure the length of their catch. Fishermen can take a picture of the fish along side with a common object like a coin. The app will determine the length of the fish. The app will also have a feature to ask help from other fishermen to identify the catch. The app will use OpenCV for image recognition.
