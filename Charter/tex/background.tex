Sport fishermen have complained that they have limited access to measuring equipment while on fishing excursions, and lack convenient systems to measure and identify their catch. Fishermen have expressed interest in a phone application that can use common objects (e.g. a coin) to measure the length of their catch, and a hotline of support from other fishermen to identify the catch, as many areas have laws on what is a lawful catch or not. This app seeks to use computer vision and social media functionality to fulfill these needs.
