Since this is a much more software based project, we will primarily only need our personal computers for programming and updating code. To test the project, we will use our smartphones to run the software and use the camera to take photos for size calculation and commenting. We will not be needing any special equipment that requires a lab, only a table to work at. There are plenty of locations on campus to work out and will be primarily meeting at the central library.
